# Project:Genesis
### About
Project Genesis is a project which get innovations from blockchain. In blockchain we enjoy to think consensus, anonymous & decentralized applications. Base on this idea I start this project Genesis. It first start from a transparent smartcontract base on Nebulas. In the contract, every developer can use Adam (maybe the first man into Oasis XD) freely, Different developer may use Adam innovatively in any posistion. Such as in one game Adam is a RPG main character, while in the other Adam is the final Boss. It is much more easier for DApp developers to have consensus on 1 character than design a brand new game base on others smart contract. This is also meaningful beacause if 1 game contain Adam is hot, the fans may want to checkout other game contain Adam. If you are interested, please join us and let the world see how we think in blockchain.
